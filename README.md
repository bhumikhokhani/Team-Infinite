Vaccines prevent disease and mortality. Getting vaccines to where they’re needed can be tricky. In addition to financial issues that prevent getting to a clinic appointment, other barriers to vaccination include distance from healthcare facilities and a shortage of providers.
We have come up with an application named "We Care". This App contains Vaccine schedules, slot bookings, Infant diets and Auto Rikshaw Services.
User can register to this App as soon as the baby is born and keep track of the immunisation and vaccination for the baby.
